# name: 🚀 Deploy Portfolio to Docker
# This is just the name of your workflow. It will appear like a title on the GitHub Actions tab when it runs.

# 🕒 on: push → branches: main
# This workflow will run only when code is pushed to the main branch

# 🛠 jobs → build-and-deploy
# This defines the main job you want GitHub to run.
# You can name this job anything — "build", "ci", "deploy", etc.

# 🧱 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
# runs-on: ubuntu-latest
# This tells GitHub to run the workflow in a Linux-based virtual machine
# (you can also use windows-latest or macos-latest, but ubuntu is fastest and free)


# ✅ steps:
# Everything inside steps is done in sequence — like a to-do list.


# 1️⃣ Checkout Code
# - name: ⬇️ Checkout code
#   uses: actions/checkout@v3
# This pulls your GitHub repo's code into the CI server.
# Without this step, GitHub Actions won’t have access to your files.


# 2️⃣ Setup Node.js
# - name: 🟢 Set up Node.js
#   uses: actions/setup-node@v3
#   with:
#     node-version: 18
# This sets up Node.js (version 18) in the environment — required for your React + Vite app to build.

# 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
# - name: 📦 Install dependencies
#   run: npm install
# Runs npm install to install everything from package.json — React, Vite, etc.

# 4️⃣ Build the App
# - name: 🔨 Build the app
#   run: npm run build
# Runs the build command (vite build) and creates your optimized dist/ folder.

# 5️⃣ Docker Build
# - name: 🐳 Docker build
#   run: docker build -t ketan-portfolio .
# This builds your Docker image from the Dockerfile you wrote.
# -t ketan-portfolio just names your image.
